**Glossary of Terms**

*EP*

EP stands for Expected Points, and is the statistic used to calculate PPA. EP
takes the down, distance, and field position situation and calculates a
measurable statistic from these variables.

*PPA*

PPA stands for Predicted Points Added, and is the statistic used in calculating
the progress a team has made in the Athletic Storm coach rating algorithm. PPA
is calculated by first calculating the EP at the start of each play and
comparing that to the EP at the end of the play. In doing this PPA shows how a
team is performing from game to game. This gives Athletic Storm a comparable
statistic

*SP+*

SP+ is a college football rating system calculated by looking at a team's
play-by-play and drive data. In the Athletic Storm coach rating algorithm, SP+
is used in taking away the bias of competitive resistance when looking at the
growth of a teamâ€™s PPA.
