**Introduction**

This introduction displays an overview of the vision document, and describes the
purpose, scope, definition, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and an overview
of the full document.

*Purpose*

The purpose of this vision document is to provide an overview of the Athletic
Storm project.

*Scope*

This document will introduce the position, describe the stakeholders and users,
discuss the documentation requirements, and provide a general analysis of the
features of Athletic Storm.

*Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations*

In this document terms unique to the genre of athletic statistics are used. In
this section those terms will be explained in full.

*EP*

EP stands for Expected Points, and is the statistic used to calculate PPA. EP
takes the down, distance, and field position situation and calculates a
measurable statistic from these variables.

*PPA*

PPA stands for Predicted Points Added, and is the statistic used in calculating
the progress a team has made in the Athletic Storm coach rating algorithm. PPA
is calculated by first calculating the EP at the start of each play and
comparing that to the EP at the end of the play. In doing this PPA shows how a
team is performing from game to game. This gives Athletic Storm a comparable
statistic

*SP+*

SP+ is a college football rating system calculated by looking at a team's
play-by-play and drive data. In the Athletic Storm coach rating algorithm, SP+
is used in taking away the bias of competitive resistance when looking at the
growth of a team’s PPA.

**Positioning**

*Business Opportunity*

The job of a division I college football coach is one of instability. For many
programs head coach, offensive coordinator, and defensive coordinator jobs are
much like a revolving door. Whenever one of these jobs comes open the
administration must make the decision of which coach should fill the open
position.

*Problem Statement*

This search for a new coach requires countless hours of research and interviews
with potential fillers. This inconvenience to the athletic department might
result in a fruitless endeavor, as the selected coach might prove to be lacking
in some departments.

*Product Position Statement*

With Athletic Storm we are trying to simplify this coaching hunt. Our software
provides a reliable standard for rating head coaches, offensive coordinators,
and defensive coordinators. The worth of a coach is placed in the talent growth
of their players. This principle is our software’s backbone. We track the growth
of athletes from game to game and through our algorithm we are able to come up
with an optimal, unbiased, coach rating procedure.

**Stakeholder and User Descriptions**

*Market Demographics*

-   View 10 teams and their coaches ratings

-   View 20 teams and their coaches ratings

-   View all teams and their coaches ratings.

*User Environment*

Each user will create an account and select a subscription tier. All users will
then select which team they would like to view. With redshirt users being
allowed to view 10 teams, starter users being allowed to view 20 teams, and mvp
users being allowed to view all teams. Once the user is at the team’s homepage
they can view the ratings of that team’s head coach, offensive coordinator, and
defensive coordinator.

*Key Stakeholder or User Needs*

The Athletic Storm application will provide a service for those who are in need
of determining how well a head coach, offensive coordinator, or defensive
coordinator is performing. When an administration is looking for a new head
coach, offensive coordinator, or defensive coordinator they no longer need to
build a report on every coach in order to make their decision. Instead, the
administration will use Athletic Storm to make an informed decision on which
coach best fits the job.

*Alternatives and Competition*

There are currently many D1 college football coach ranking websites, but there
are no D1 college football coach rating websites. Because of the similarity
between ranking and rating the ranking genre will be considered as competition.
The most popular D1 college football coaching ranking websites are Bleacher
Report, CBS Sports, and ESPN.

These websites have people who monitor the college football season, and from
their finding they rank D1 college football coaches. This means that their
ranking algorithm is biased based on their beliefs. However, the site’s bias is
overlooked based on the name of the site. ESPN, CBS Sports, and Bleacher Report
all have very recognizable names that cary trust in the consumer’s eye.

Unlike the competition, Athletic Storm uses an unbiased algorithm for rating the
head coach, offensive coordinator, and defensive coordinator of a program. The
ratings developed by Athletic Storm are strictly based on statistical evidence
taken from the improvement of the coach’s team from week to week.

**Product Overview**

The Athletic Storm application aims to provide a user friendly, reliable, and
unbiased platform for users to see the performance of D1 college football
coaches. Key features of this application include: analyzing a team’s
improvement over time in order to rate that teams coaches, displaying the
ratings associated with a given teams coaches, and displaying other important
information about a given team and the team’s head coach, offensive coordinator,
and defensive coordinator.

*Product Perspectives*

The Athletic Storm application will be built using kubernetes with three docker
containers. Data for this application will be stored in a MySQL database docker
image. The base of this application is using a Spring framework, with Java
serving as the backend. More data will also be filtered through the Athletic
Storm REST API. For the front end, NodeJS and associated JavaScript will be used
to render web pages. Connecting the client to the kubernetes will be a Nginx
Reverse Proxy. The client will also retrieve data from the College Football API.

*Assumptions and Dependencies*

There are several assumptions and dependencies that are connected with the
technologies being used. Primarily, in order to access the application users
must have internet connection. The final product will be released as a web
application and not as a desktop or android/iOS application. A further
assumption is that the user will be operating the application in English. At
this time, no plans are made to release the application in any languages other
than English. Testing for the application will occur primarily in the browsers
Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and support for the application in other
browsers is not guaranteed.

*Cost and Pricing*

The pricing of Athletic Storm is built on a subscription basis. There are three
tiers of Athletic Storm users: redshirt users, starter users, and mvp users.
Redshirt users are required to pay \$4.99 monthly in order to view 10 teams.
Starter users are required to pay \$9.99 monthly in order to view 20 teams. MVP
users are required to pay \$14.99 in order to view all teams.
